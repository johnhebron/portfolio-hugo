Hi, I‚Äôm John üëã I am a Senior Software Engineer (5+ years) with a passion for building teams and services. I am hoping to find a medium size company (~200+) where I can make a real impact beyond just my day-to-day coding. I‚Äôm looking for an amazing team where I can be a ‚Äúculture add‚Äù, not just a ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù.
