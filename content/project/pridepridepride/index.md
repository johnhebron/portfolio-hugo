title: "PridePridePride (2020-2021)"
summary: "In partnership with a good friend, we launched PridePridePride in 2020 to run a fundraiser to support a LGBTQ teenager who was attacked near our hometown.<br><br>
From there, the business grew to create two sets of LGBTQ+ Greeting Cards and an *amazing* pride themed box."
