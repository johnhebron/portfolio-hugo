title: "Nerdy Onesies (2018-2020)"
summary: "I launched a much more successful iteration of the custom baby onesie business, Nerdy Onesies, focused on more niche designs around pop culture and technology.
<br><br>
At it's peak, Nerdy Onesies was able to pull in multiple thousands of dollars a month through only part time efforts, utilizing a BigCommerce storefront, Etsy, and Amazon (with and without Fulfillment by Amazon)."
